<p>	An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree. 
	Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 
	The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.

<p>	An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae.
	It primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange.

<p>	A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.
	The cultivation of grapes began perhaps 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food over history. 
	Eaten fresh or in dried form (as raisins, currants and sultanas), grapes also hold cultural significance in many parts of the world, particularly for their role in winemaking. 
	Other grape-derived products include various types of jam, juice, vinegar and oil.

<p>	A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. 
	It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. 
	indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". 
	Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.

<img src="Banana.jpg" height="100" id = "b" />
<p>	A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. 
	The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. 
	The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. 
	The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.
